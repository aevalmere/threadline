# DECISIONS.md

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. **Never rewrite or delete an entry** — if a decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes it and say so.

Log an entry when: a locked-stack rule is bent, the schema deviates from `SPEC.md`, a bug survives two failed attempts (Non-negotiable 6), or a non-obvious tradeoff is made that a future session would otherwise re-litigate.

## #1 — 2026-08-09 — The stack

**Decision.** Vite + React + TypeScript SPA (react-router) · Supabase for Postgres / Auth / Realtime / Storage · shadcn/ui + Tailwind · BlockNote (free core only) · dnd-kit · Postgres full-text search · Cloudflare Pages auto-deploying from GitHub `main`.

**Why.**
- **SPA, not Next.js.** The entire backend is Supabase, so there is no server-side work for a meta-framework to do. A static SPA deploys to Cloudflare Pages for $0 with no ToS friction, and it deletes an entire class of bugs — server-vs-client component confusion, hydration mismatches, env vars leaking across the boundary.
- **Supabase, not a hand-rolled backend.** Postgres, auth, realtime, storage, and row-level security from one vendor with one CLI and one client library. At 5–30 users the free tier is comfortable. Migrations are CLI-managed from day one so production schema is never hand-edited in a dashboard.
- **Magic links, no passwords.** Nothing to reset, nothing to leak, no password UI to build. Public signups are disabled; the user invites teammates from the dashboard — that *is* the access-control system.
- **shadcn/ui.** Source-in-repo components, so there is no upgrade treadmill and no fighting a design system. Chat surfaces get scaffolded from its chat components rather than hand-rolled.
- **Postgres FTS, not Meilisearch/Typesense/Algolia.** One `search_all()` function, zero extra infrastructure, zero extra dollars, zero sync pipeline to keep consistent. At this data volume it is comfortably fast.
- **dnd-kit.** react-beautiful-dnd is unmaintained.
- **BlockNote free core only.** XL packages are paid; the core covers Notion-lite editing.

**Consequence.** These are locked for v1. No swaps, no overlapping additions, no state-management framework without a superseding entry here.

## #2 — 2026-08-09 — `messages.id` is `bigint identity`, not `uuid`

**Decision.** `messages.id bigint generated always as identity`. Every other table keeps `uuid default gen_random_uuid()`. Consequently the polymorphic id columns — `links.source_id`, `links.target_id`, `attachments.owner_id`, `notifications.entity_id`, and `search_all`'s `entity_id` — are `text`.

**Why.** Two P1 requirements are literally comparisons on message id: unread counts (`id > channel_members.last_read_message_id`) and reconnect resync (`WHERE id > last_seen`). Random uuids have no meaningful order, so both would need a join against `created_at` — which can tie under concurrent inserts and is therefore not a stable cursor. A monotonic bigint makes unread counts, keyset pagination, and resync one-liners each, and keeps the indexes small on the highest-volume table in the app.

**Cost accepted.** The database holds two id types, so polymorphic columns become `text`. This is cheap because `links` and `attachments` were already specified as polymorphic with integrity enforced in app code. Typed foreign keys stay typed: `tasks.source_message_id bigint`, `tasks.source_post_id uuid`.

## #3 — 2026-08-09 — Seed script authenticates without passwords

**Decision.** `scripts/seed.ts` proves the blanket RLS policy (Non-negotiable 2) by minting a real user session through `auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'magiclink' })` and redeeming the returned `hashed_token` via `verifyOtp` on a plain **anon** client — then running select / insert / update / delete against a live table.

**Why.** The check has to run through the anon client to be worth anything, and magic links can't be clicked from a script. The obvious alternative — give the seed users passwords and call `signInWithPassword` — would put real password credentials in a database whose whole auth story is "magic links only", and would mean storing that password somewhere for the test to read.

**Fallback if `generateLink` proves unreliable.** Switch to password-based seed users, keep the passwords in `.env.local` only, and append a superseding entry here.

**Scope.** The `service_role` key this script needs lives in `.env.local` (gitignored) and is used *only* by `scripts/`. It is never imported from `src/`, never committed, and never placed in a Cloudflare Pages environment variable.
